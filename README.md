Tech Stacks

MEAN :- 
MongoDB (NoSQL database), Express.js backend web framework, Angular.js frontend framework, NodeJS open-source, cross-platform server - MEAN provides a practical approach to creating fast and highly efficient apps. All the components speak JSON (JavaScript Object Notations) for data transmission and free module library access

MERN :- 
MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.
The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use codes on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).

MEVN :- 
Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.

Ruby on Rails :- 
Ruby on Rails is a programming environment that uses Ruby, a dynamic programming language. With RoR, you can simplify the entire development process.

The Serverless Stack :- 
Serverless computing platforms provide all the services and tools thus making infrastructure management much simpler. You can easily scale up to hundreds of thousands of users overnight.
